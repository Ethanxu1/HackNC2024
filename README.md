Our Usage:

First, we used financial formulas we found online (such as compound interest calculation) in our calculator functions. For our chatbot, it puts calls through to the ChatGPT API to inform users on how to navigate the calculator we built, along with other information on the site and further resources if they are interested. We are working on specializing the GPT. We also are working on adding two other secondary features to specific resources that UNC students may find helpful.
