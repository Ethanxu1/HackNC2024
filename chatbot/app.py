    "rate": "If you know what your interest rate is, you should input it under the rate column. Otherwise, I have a default rate of 5.00 percent set up for use!",
    "time": "Here is what you can do with the time feature. I put in a default value of repayment of loan within one year, but you can change the values in this column to create repayment plans of different lengths (and find their respective monthly payments!)",
    "other": "I'm happy to help you with more financial questions you may have as a UNC student. However, I am still learning about such topics and would suggest you refer to the UNC Scholarships and Student Aid page first.",
    "Budget Planner": "Let's map out your budget! Tell me your monthly income, fixed expenses (like rent or tuition), and flexible expenses (like groceries or entertainment), and Iâ€™ll help you see where you might save or adjust. Let's work toward a balanced budget!",

    "Emergency Fund Calculator" : "Do you have an emergency fund goal? An emergency fund is there for unexpected expenses, like car repairs or medical bills. Let's calculate how much you might need based on your expenses and lifestyle!",
    "Scholarship and Grant Finder" : "Did you know there are tons of scholarships and grants available? I can guide you on where to search, from local scholarships to more national opportunities. Saving on tuition costs is a win!",
    "Tax Tips" :  "Filing taxes for the first time? I can provide tips on student tax deductions, including credits for tuition, textbooks, and other college-related expenses.",
    "Financial Wellness Tips" : "Want to build healthy financial habits? I can share quick tips and reminders, like setting small goals, managing impulse spending, and reviewing your budget monthly."
